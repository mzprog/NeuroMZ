# NeuroMZ
## Artificial Neural Network Manager.
NeuroMZ is created to have simple processing form of the artificial neural network.<br>
this project will help us to work under ANN in different way that will make it easier.<br>
I hope to you all to help me to make this project perfect and solve all problems in ANN for c/c++ programmers<br>
the target of this project to build this terminal program and to build a dev package for programmers<br>
the terminal or command program to build the basics of the neural network that we need it and the dev package or libary its for using this neural network in a program.
current version: 1.0<br>
<br>
to learn how to use NeuroMZ you can read the Neuromz.pdf in the docs directory ;
