targets for verion 1.1:
linking the new activation function with the command function and the testArgs
ex:
new 2 [6 74 34 23] :sigmoid 2 :tanh 1 :relu
so we need to make bracket for the sequence of layer and :ACTFX to specify the activation function 
or without the bracket to select just te previous layer to set its activation function
